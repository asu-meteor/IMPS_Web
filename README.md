IMPS on the web

## Setup

After cloning the repo, open a terminal to the cloned destination and use [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) to install the required modules.

```bash
npm ci
```

## Local hosting

After installing the required modules, host the website locally.

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should be met with the Vite console program. Look at the "Local" field for the IP your website is hosted at.
You can now open up your favorite browser and navigate to the locally hosted website.
